This site is about my travel experiences during 2020-21 lockdown. Including:<ol>
  <li>Counting Places not Cities</li>
  <li>Virtual City Break Planning</li>

Travel is important to me. As part of enjoying life. By creating new experiences and revisiting enjoyable locations. During lockdown, travel was limited to local exercise. So instead of aiming to travel to new cities each month, I walked new routes.

I intended to plan city breaks for after lockdown. But I never focused enough on real plans. Being content with vague ideas of where I might visit. But today, I'm trying to kickstart travel plans. By doing some virtual visits to places that attract me. Then I'll decide if and when I will continue with actual visits.

More on that in the days and weeks ahead. When I will expand those thoughts in blog articles. Then revise the overview here. Also, I will complete 'admin' pages for:
